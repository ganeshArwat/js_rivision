     Problem statement: build star pattern.

     ## Requirements:
     Ques: What are the features that we want in that project.

     Must have feature:
        1. Rating from 1 to 5.
        2. When we click -> rating should appears in count and in star as well.
        3. A hover effect should be there even after click?


    Good to have features -> optimization, accessibility
        1. Can we put emojies instead of number.
        2. Slider based rating.

    Approach:
        1. HTML/CSS:
           Prepare with basic/static HTML/CSS.

        2. Javascript:
           a. We have to listen to three events.
              i. Click -> Give the rating.
                          Update star upto that level.
                          Update rating count.

             ii. Mouseover -> We have to chnage the star upto that level to yellow color without chnaging the rating once rating is given.

             Edge Case:
             iii. MouseLeave: move it back to gray star/yellow.
